## Just-landed fixes (claude/audit-workflow-friction-XD56a — 2026-05-14)

These patterns recurred multiple times; the fix is now in source. If
the next session sees them re-fire, the regression test is missing —
fix forward AND add a test.

- `[FIXED] data-main-py-missing-on-fresh-clone` — `bootstrap.sh` now
  guards on `[[ -f data/main.py ]]`, not on "any non-gitkeep file".
  Stops `data/shot_validator/` from masking the download skip.
  Recurred 3x (5/10, 5/12, 5/13).
- `[FIXED] kaggle-cli-401-wrong-auth-env-var` — `bootstrap.sh` now
  detects `KGAT_`-prefix tokens and routes them via
  `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` instead of `kaggle.json`'s legacy 32-hex path.
  Also maps harness names (`KaggleUserName` / `KaggleAPIToke`) to
  canonical. Plus a `kaggle competitions list -s orbit` cred smoke
  surfaces 401s in minute one. Recurred 3x (5/10, 5/12, 5/13).
- `[FIXED] pip-blinker-system-conflict` — `bootstrap.sh` does a
  `pip install --ignore-installed blinker` preflight before
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Stops Debian's record-less
  `python3-blinker` from aborting the whole install.
- `[FIXED] bundler-missing-block-e-modules` (and 5 related tags) —
  `scripts/bundle_agent.py` now raises `RuntimeError` if any
  `from lib.X import ...` strips to an X not in the bundle order
  list. No more silent-NameError bundles. Bundle parity-gate alone
  was insufficient — the historical parity test used `v1_orbitfix`,
  which doesn't exercise the snipe-stack mission framework.
- `[FIXED] bundler-overwrites-tracked-submission` — bundler refuses
  to overwrite a git-tracked file in `submissions/` without
  `--force`. Caught one silent deletion of `v7_0_drop_one.py` on 5/13.
- `[CODIFIED] consecutive-falsification-cap` — Rule 37 in CLAUDE.md.
  3+ consecutive variants in the same design axis ⇒ pivot or
  escalate. Cost evidence: v7_X chooser axis sweep on 5/13-14 burned
  6 h on diminishing-EV variants past v7_3.
- `[CODIFIED] kaggle-kernel-mandatory-two-tier-smoke` — folded into
  Rule 2. Local CPU single-state smoke + small-scale GPU smoke
  before any production T4 push. Cost evidence: 90 min T4 quota on
  a JIT compile a 5-min CPU run would have flagged.
- `[FIXED] local-vs-v7_0-only-misses-ladder-distribution` —
  `fast.py eval --vs-panel` runs a 3-opponent calibration panel
  (`v7_0`, `v4_planner`, `v3.5.1`) by opt-in; PASS verdict requires
  every opponent's Wilson lower bound ≥ gate, not pooled. v3.5.1
  (5/12, -150μ vs prediction) and geo v3.1 (5/14, -80μ floor) both
  passed single-opponent A/Bs and regressed on the ladder.
  **Open follow-up:** make `--vs-panel` mandatory before submission
  (workflow rule, not yet hard-gated in source).

## Newly-fired patterns (this session)

- `tag: detached-bg-killed-on-session-resume` — 2026-05-15
  capture-and-secure session: panel suite launched via Bash tool's
  `run_in_background` at 18:27 UTC ran ~3 h, but the resume-script
  variant (using `nohup setsid ... & disown`) was killed at the next
  SessionStart hook ~10 h later. Both ran fine while the launching
  session was alive; both died across the session boundary. **Root
  cause:** the harness's session-reset appears to reap the process
  group regardless of `setsid`/`disown`. **Fix:** for long jobs that
  must cross a session boundary, the bash-tool `run_in_background`
  path is the only one I've seen survive; relaunch on each resume if
  it dies. Possibly worth a guarded session-start re-launcher that
  detects an interrupted `panel.log` and resumes the missing variants.
- `tag: local-overpredict-2x` (3rd recurrence) — 2026-05-15 secure-
  variants: geo_recap panel mean 60.9 % across 192 games. Local
  experience says the live discount is ~6–7 pp (v3.5.1 5/12: −15 pp;
  geo v3.1 5/14: −7 pp). Submission was held because expected live
  ~54 % is not decisively above v7_pv's 1062.2 μ; eviction risk
  dominates EV. **Tag fired 3×:** v3.5.1, geo v3.1, geo_recap-decision.
  **Promotion candidate:** local A/B mean must clear (gate + discount)
  before submission, not just gate alone. To `.claude/skills/kaggle-
  comp/improvements.md`.

- `tag: fix-not-validated-against-real-failing-state` — 2026-05-14
  audit-pass: I patched `bootstrap.sh` for `data-main-py-missing-on-
  fresh-clone`, ran the unit guards (syntax check, AST tests, --help
  output), saw 16 pytest failures with the exact `data/main.py` error
  string the patch was meant to neutralise, and categorised them as
  "pre-existing, not regression" instead of running the patched
  bootstrap. PI caught it: "you have not been able to bootstrap
  properly even though you noticed the friction." Same pattern as
  `agent-introspection-skipped-bootstrap` (2026-05-13). **Root cause:**
  fix-verification protocol was "unit-test the new code path" rather
  than "reproduce the failure state and confirm fix neutralises it."
  The rule was written in friction.md but never bound because friction
  notes don't gate behaviour. **Fix this session:** promoted to
  CLAUDE.md Rule 38; bumped SessionStart bootstrap hook to top
  pending in `improvements.md`.

## Still-open patterns (next-session priority)

- `tag: handover-stale-at-session-start-no-git-log-check` — Rule 32
  already requires session-start `git fetch + git log HEAD..origin/main`.
  Enforcement is aspirational. **Promotion candidate:** SessionStart
  hook (the `session-start-hook` skill exists in this environment).
  Cost evidence: 5/13 LATE wrote a full plan-mode design for work
  already completed on the same branch (`cb02fd9`, `4ba55f4`).
- `tag: jax-vmap-already-wired` — claimed integration was missing
  while it was actually live. **Pattern lesson:** before claiming a
  capability is unbuilt, grep `agents/*_v*_*/main.py` and
  `lib/*.py` for existing wrappers. Specifically applies to
  `score_candidate_jax_pure_jit` (6 ms after JIT).
- `tag: geo-v2-three-failed-wallclock-fixes` — three orthogonal
  attempts to bound the K=10 lookahead's max-wallclock all regressed
  strategy more than they saved time. **Promotion candidate:** when
  a single-knob change costs more than it saves in three orthogonal
  directions, the config IS the local optimum — stop tuning;
  submit if positive, find structurally different lever otherwise.
- `tag: env-clone-cost-grows-with-history` — `env.clone()` cost rises
  4× across an episode (5.6 ms cold → 22 ms warm) because
  `Environment.clone()` walks `self.steps`. Mid/end-game rollout
  cost is hosed; `lib/fast_sim.py` is the working bypass.
- `tag: trueskill-noise-vs-signal` — TrueSkill σ is large for the
  first ~24 h after submit (initial σ≈300, shrinks ∝ 1/√N). Wait
  ≥24 h before reading rank delta into strategy decisions.

## How to add an entry

```
- `tag: <kebab-slug>` — <session context>: <what happened>.
  <Root cause>. **Fix:** <concrete action>.
```

Reuse tags. New tags get one cycle of grace before promotion. If a
tag fires 3+ times, it goes to
`.claude/skills/kaggle-comp/improvements.md` and then into the
relevant skill file or source code, not back into friction.md.

## Anti-spam — what does NOT belong here

- Successful experiments → `audit/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`.
- LB / rank results → `state/calibration-ladder.md`.
- Hypothesis churn → `state/hypothesis-board.md`.
- Multi-paragraph reasoning → audit postmortem or
  `knowledge-base/thoughts/`.

If something is worth a paragraph, it's not friction. It's a real
postmortem.
