## Just-landed fixes (claude/audit-workflow-friction-XD56a — 2026-05-14)

These patterns recurred multiple times; the fix is now in source. If
the next session sees them re-fire, the regression test is missing —
fix forward AND add a test.

- `[FIXED] data-main-py-missing-on-fresh-clone` — `bootstrap.sh` now
  guards on `[[ -f data/main.py ]]`, not on "any non-gitkeep file".
  Stops `data/shot_validator/` from masking the download skip.
  Recurred 3x (5/10, 5/12, 5/13).
- `[FIXED] kaggle-cli-401-wrong-auth-env-var` — `bootstrap.sh` now
  detects `KGAT_`-prefix tokens and routes them via
  `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` instead of `kaggle.json`'s legacy 32-hex path.
  Also maps harness names (`KaggleUserName` / `KaggleAPIToke`) to
  canonical. Plus a `kaggle competitions list -s orbit` cred smoke
  surfaces 401s in minute one. Recurred 3x (5/10, 5/12, 5/13).
- `[FIXED] pip-blinker-system-conflict` — `bootstrap.sh` does a
  `pip install --ignore-installed blinker` preflight before
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Stops Debian's record-less
  `python3-blinker` from aborting the whole install.
- `[FIXED] bundler-missing-block-e-modules` (and 5 related tags) —
  `scripts/bundle_agent.py` now raises `RuntimeError` if any
  `from lib.X import ...` strips to an X not in the bundle order
  list. No more silent-NameError bundles. Bundle parity-gate alone
  was insufficient — the historical parity test used `v1_orbitfix`,
  which doesn't exercise the snipe-stack mission framework.
- `[FIXED] bundler-overwrites-tracked-submission` — bundler refuses
  to overwrite a git-tracked file in `submissions/` without
  `--force`. Caught one silent deletion of `v7_0_drop_one.py` on 5/13.
- `[CODIFIED] consecutive-falsification-cap` — Rule 37 in CLAUDE.md.
  3+ consecutive variants in the same design axis ⇒ pivot or
  escalate. Cost evidence: v7_X chooser axis sweep on 5/13-14 burned
  6 h on diminishing-EV variants past v7_3.
- `[CODIFIED] kaggle-kernel-mandatory-two-tier-smoke` — folded into
  Rule 2. Local CPU single-state smoke + small-scale GPU smoke
  before any production T4 push. Cost evidence: 90 min T4 quota on
  a JIT compile a 5-min CPU run would have flagged.
- `[FIXED] local-vs-v7_0-only-misses-ladder-distribution` —
  `fast.py eval --vs-panel` runs a 3-opponent calibration panel
  (`v7_0`, `v4_planner`, `v3.5.1`) by opt-in; PASS verdict requires
  every opponent's Wilson lower bound ≥ gate, not pooled. v3.5.1
  (5/12, -150μ vs prediction) and geo v3.1 (5/14, -80μ floor) both
  passed single-opponent A/Bs and regressed on the ladder.
  **Open follow-up:** make `--vs-panel` mandatory before submission
  (workflow rule, not yet hard-gated in source).

## Still-open patterns (next-session priority)

- `tag: handover-stale-at-session-start-no-git-log-check` — Rule 32
  already requires session-start `git fetch + git log HEAD..origin/main`.
  Enforcement is aspirational. **Promotion candidate:** SessionStart
  hook (the `session-start-hook` skill exists in this environment).
  Cost evidence: 5/13 LATE wrote a full plan-mode design for work
  already completed on the same branch (`cb02fd9`, `4ba55f4`).
- `tag: jax-vmap-already-wired` — claimed integration was missing
  while it was actually live. **Pattern lesson:** before claiming a
  capability is unbuilt, grep `agents/*_v*_*/main.py` and
  `lib/*.py` for existing wrappers. Specifically applies to
  `score_candidate_jax_pure_jit` (6 ms after JIT).
- `tag: geo-v2-three-failed-wallclock-fixes` — three orthogonal
  attempts to bound the K=10 lookahead's max-wallclock all regressed
  strategy more than they saved time. **Promotion candidate:** when
  a single-knob change costs more than it saves in three orthogonal
  directions, the config IS the local optimum — stop tuning;
  submit if positive, find structurally different lever otherwise.
- `tag: env-clone-cost-grows-with-history` — `env.clone()` cost rises
  4× across an episode (5.6 ms cold → 22 ms warm) because
  `Environment.clone()` walks `self.steps`. Mid/end-game rollout
  cost is hosed; `lib/fast_sim.py` is the working bypass.
- `tag: trueskill-noise-vs-signal` — TrueSkill σ is large for the
  first ~24 h after submit (initial σ≈300, shrinks ∝ 1/√N). Wait
  ≥24 h before reading rank delta into strategy decisions.

## How to add an entry

```
- `tag: <kebab-slug>` — <session context>: <what happened>.
  <Root cause>. **Fix:** <concrete action>.
```

Reuse tags. New tags get one cycle of grace before promotion. If a
tag fires 3+ times, it goes to
`.claude/skills/kaggle-comp/improvements.md` and then into the
relevant skill file or source code, not back into friction.md.

## Anti-spam — what does NOT belong here

- Successful experiments → `audit/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`.
- LB / rank results → `state/calibration-ladder.md`.
- Hypothesis churn → `state/hypothesis-board.md`.
- Multi-paragraph reasoning → audit postmortem or
  `knowledge-base/thoughts/`.

If something is worth a paragraph, it's not friction. It's a real
postmortem.
