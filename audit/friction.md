## Just-landed fixes (claude/audit-workflow-friction-XD56a — 2026-05-14)

These patterns recurred multiple times; the fix is now in source. If
the next session sees them re-fire, the regression test is missing —
fix forward AND add a test.

- `[FIXED] data-main-py-missing-on-fresh-clone` — `bootstrap.sh` now
  guards on `[[ -f data/main.py ]]`, not on "any non-gitkeep file".
  Stops `data/shot_validator/` from masking the download skip.
  Recurred 3x (5/10, 5/12, 5/13).
- `[FIXED] kaggle-cli-401-wrong-auth-env-var` — `bootstrap.sh` now
  detects `KGAT_`-prefix tokens and routes them via
  `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` instead of `kaggle.json`'s legacy 32-hex path.
  Also maps harness names (`KaggleUserName` / `KaggleAPIToke`) to
  canonical. Plus a `kaggle competitions list -s orbit` cred smoke
  surfaces 401s in minute one. Recurred 3x (5/10, 5/12, 5/13).
- `[FIXED] pip-blinker-system-conflict` — `bootstrap.sh` does a
  `pip install --ignore-installed blinker` preflight before
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Stops Debian's record-less
  `python3-blinker` from aborting the whole install.
- `[FIXED] bundler-missing-block-e-modules` (and 5 related tags) —
  `scripts/bundle_agent.py` now raises `RuntimeError` if any
  `from lib.X import ...` strips to an X not in the bundle order
  list. No more silent-NameError bundles. Bundle parity-gate alone
  was insufficient — the historical parity test used `v1_orbitfix`,
  which doesn't exercise the snipe-stack mission framework.
- `[FIXED] bundler-overwrites-tracked-submission` — bundler refuses
  to overwrite a git-tracked file in `submissions/` without
  `--force`. Caught one silent deletion of `v7_0_drop_one.py` on 5/13.
- `[CODIFIED] consecutive-falsification-cap` — Rule 37 in CLAUDE.md.
  3+ consecutive variants in the same design axis ⇒ pivot or
  escalate. Cost evidence: v7_X chooser axis sweep on 5/13-14 burned
  6 h on diminishing-EV variants past v7_3.
- `[CODIFIED] kaggle-kernel-mandatory-two-tier-smoke` — folded into
  Rule 2. Local CPU single-state smoke + small-scale GPU smoke
  before any production T4 push. Cost evidence: 90 min T4 quota on
  a JIT compile a 5-min CPU run would have flagged.
- `[FIXED] local-vs-v7_0-only-misses-ladder-distribution` —
  `fast.py eval --vs-panel` runs a 3-opponent calibration panel
  (`v7_0`, `v4_planner`, `v3.5.1`) by opt-in; PASS verdict requires
  every opponent's Wilson lower bound ≥ gate, not pooled. v3.5.1
  (5/12, -150μ vs prediction) and geo v3.1 (5/14, -80μ floor) both
  passed single-opponent A/Bs and regressed on the ladder.
  **Open follow-up:** make `--vs-panel` mandatory before submission
  (workflow rule, not yet hard-gated in source).

## Newly-fired patterns (this session)

- `tag: fix-not-validated-against-real-failing-state` — 2026-05-14
  audit-pass: I patched `bootstrap.sh` for `data-main-py-missing-on-
  fresh-clone`, ran the unit guards (syntax check, AST tests, --help
  output), saw 16 pytest failures with the exact `data/main.py` error
  string the patch was meant to neutralise, and categorised them as
  "pre-existing, not regression" instead of running the patched
  bootstrap. PI caught it: "you have not been able to bootstrap
  properly even though you noticed the friction." Same pattern as
  `agent-introspection-skipped-bootstrap` (2026-05-13). **Root cause:**
  fix-verification protocol was "unit-test the new code path" rather
  than "reproduce the failure state and confirm fix neutralises it."
  The rule was written in friction.md but never bound because friction
  notes don't gate behaviour. **Fix this session:** promoted to
  CLAUDE.md Rule 38; bumped SessionStart bootstrap hook to top
  pending in `improvements.md`.

- `tag: helper-reimplemented-inline-silently-wrong` — 2026-05-14
  game-strategy-eda-roatN: bundling-friendly inline rewrite of
  `lib.orbit.is_orbiting` checked `dist_from_sun > 0.5 AND radius > 0`
  instead of `orb_r + planet_radius < ROTATION_RADIUS_LIMIT`. Every
  self-play board reported `orbital_frac=1.00` (training corpus
  0.27-0.44); KMeans nearest-centroid put every board in cluster 3.
  v2 sweep ran at 67% vs v7_0 — looked encouraging — actually noise
  from the forced-C3 high-cadence template. **Root cause:** I
  paraphrased the library invariant instead of inlining the formula
  verbatim. **Fix this session:** corrected the proxy + added an
  outlier-distance threshold; the broader fix needed is a project
  rule like "when inlining for bundling, paste the source line, not
  a proxy" — promotion candidate for `improvements.md`.

- `tag: broken-mechanism-yields-fake-positive-signal` — 2026-05-14
  same session: the v2 sweep's 67% point estimate against v7_0 was
  taken as "directionally encouraging" support for the cluster-
  conditional overlay. After fixing the underlying classifier bug
  (above), v3 sweep collapsed to 53% with overlay-active games at
  46% and pure-v7-fallback at 80%. The "encouraging" result was the
  bug. **Root cause:** acted on a positive sweep result without
  verifying the upstream mechanism (the classifier) was actually
  classifying. **Fix forward:** any "we beat the panel by X%"
  reading requires a 30-second sanity print of what the agent
  actually does (cluster distribution, launch count distribution)
  before treating the number as signal.

- `tag: soft-clusters-need-confidence-fallback` — 2026-05-14 same
  session: Mine 1 had already flagged silhouette ≈0.17 ("clusters
  are real but not sharply separated") as a risk; I treated the
  k=4 KMeans output as a usable categorical anyway. With centroid
  distances spread training p25=2.05 → p95=3.30, marginal boards
  get force-routed into a wrong template. **Root cause:** soft
  clusters + hard nearest-centroid classification = templates
  applied where they don't fit. **Fix forward:** when silhouette
  < 0.20, the classifier ships with a confidence threshold (defer
  to a default policy beyond p90 distance) from day 1, not after
  a failed sweep.

## Still-open patterns (next-session priority)

- `tag: handover-stale-at-session-start-no-git-log-check` — Rule 32
  already requires session-start `git fetch + git log HEAD..origin/main`.
  Enforcement is aspirational. **Promotion candidate:** SessionStart
  hook (the `session-start-hook` skill exists in this environment).
  Cost evidence: 5/13 LATE wrote a full plan-mode design for work
  already completed on the same branch (`cb02fd9`, `4ba55f4`).
- `tag: jax-vmap-already-wired` — claimed integration was missing
  while it was actually live. **Pattern lesson:** before claiming a
  capability is unbuilt, grep `agents/*_v*_*/main.py` and
  `lib/*.py` for existing wrappers. Specifically applies to
  `score_candidate_jax_pure_jit` (6 ms after JIT).
- `tag: geo-v2-three-failed-wallclock-fixes` — three orthogonal
  attempts to bound the K=10 lookahead's max-wallclock all regressed
  strategy more than they saved time. **Promotion candidate:** when
  a single-knob change costs more than it saves in three orthogonal
  directions, the config IS the local optimum — stop tuning;
  submit if positive, find structurally different lever otherwise.
- `tag: env-clone-cost-grows-with-history` — `env.clone()` cost rises
  4× across an episode (5.6 ms cold → 22 ms warm) because
  `Environment.clone()` walks `self.steps`. Mid/end-game rollout
  cost is hosed; `lib/fast_sim.py` is the working bypass.
- `tag: trueskill-noise-vs-signal` — TrueSkill σ is large for the
  first ~24 h after submit (initial σ≈300, shrinks ∝ 1/√N). Wait
  ≥24 h before reading rank delta into strategy decisions.

## How to add an entry

```
- `tag: <kebab-slug>` — <session context>: <what happened>.
  <Root cause>. **Fix:** <concrete action>.
```

Reuse tags. New tags get one cycle of grace before promotion. If a
tag fires 3+ times, it goes to
`.claude/skills/kaggle-comp/improvements.md` and then into the
relevant skill file or source code, not back into friction.md.

## Anti-spam — what does NOT belong here

- Successful experiments → `audit/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`.
- LB / rank results → `state/calibration-ladder.md`.
- Hypothesis churn → `state/hypothesis-board.md`.
- Multi-paragraph reasoning → audit postmortem or
  `knowledge-base/thoughts/`.

If something is worth a paragraph, it's not friction. It's a real
postmortem.
