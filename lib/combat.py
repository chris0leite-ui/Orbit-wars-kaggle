"""Combat resolver per env spec (data/README.md §combat).

Pure function: given a planet's current `(garrison_owner, garrison_ships)`
and a list of arriving fleets at the same step (each `(owner, ships)`),
compute the post-combat `(new_owner, new_ships)`.

Rules (data/README.md):
1. Same-step arrivals are grouped by owner; ship counts summed.
2. Largest attacker fights second-largest; difference survives.
3a. If survivor's owner == garrison's owner, survivor joins garrison.
3b. If survivor's owner != garrison's owner, survivor fights garrison;
    if survivor ships > garrison ships, ownership flips to survivor.
4.  Two-way tie among attackers: all destroyed (no survivors).

This implementation matches Roman 1224's `resolve_arrival_event` semantically
(audit/2026-05-10-public-kernel-teardown.md), adapted to our naming.
