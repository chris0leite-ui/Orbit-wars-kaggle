"""settle_plan — per-source greedy with a same-turn arrival ledger.

v3.1 solver. Each source picks the highest-score mission whose target
isn't already over-committed by earlier-this-turn picks. Two key
invariants:

1. **Allow gang-up when needed.** Multiple sources MAY pick the same
   target if a single source's contribution is insufficient (e.g. when
   the defender's predicted garrison exceeds one source's affordable
   fleet). The first attempt at v3.0 used a blanket no-double-commit
   rule and regressed on dense boards (`audit/2026-05-11-block-e-
   snipe-mvp.md`).
2. **Prevent overcommit when one source is enough.** The earlier v2
   strategy-level greedy couldn't see this-turn launches by other
   sources, so two sources could both pile on a lightly-defended
   target and waste the surplus. The same-turn ledger fixes this:
   after each pick, the mission's `(eta, ships)` is registered, and
   subsequent sources see the cumulative pending arrivals at each
   target. A mission is skipped only if the cumulative arrivals by
   its eta already exceed the predicted enemy garrison + 1 buffer.

The ledger logic is class-agnostic — it works for snipe, reinforce,
and any future mission class that targets a planet. For reinforce
missions, the "target" is OUR planet and the env's combat resolver
adds surplus to garrison (same-owner arrivals don't fight).

Pure function of (missions, world, model). The ledger is rebuilt per
call; no state leaks across turns.

    """Pick at most one mission per source under a same-turn ledger.

    Algorithm:
    1. Bucket missions by source; sort each bucket by score descending.
    2. Order sources by their top-mission score (highest first).
    3. For each source in order, walk its ranked candidates and accept
       the first one whose target isn't already over-committed by
       prior this-turn picks.
    4. After accepting a mission, register its arrival in the ledger.

    Idle-source tracing (opt-in): pass a `reasons` dict to receive a
    classification of why each non-emitting owned-and-shipped source
    went idle this turn. Keys are planet ids; values are one of:

    - `"NO_PROPOSALS"` — no proposer emitted a Mission for this source.
    - `"LEDGER_LOSS"` — proposer(s) emitted Mission(s) but all were
      skipped because earlier this-turn picks already covered every
      candidate target.

    `MECHANISM_DROP` (intent built but dropped by the realize pipeline)
    is set by `lib.intent.realize`, not here, since this function returns
    before mechanisms run.
