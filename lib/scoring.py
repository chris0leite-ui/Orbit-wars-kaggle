"""Shared scoring primitives for ROI-family strategies.

These helpers project fleet arrival deterministically against the current
obs snapshot. Variants under `agents/simple/roi_*.py` build their score
function on top of these primitives — the goal is that any strategy that
wants "what does this target look like at arrival" gets one consistent
answer rather than re-implementing the projection per file.

Caveat: the projection is single-pass and uses the current `target.ships`
to seed fleet speed. Strategies that send larger fleets (post-
`arrival_size` inflation) actually arrive a hair sooner, so `eta_proxy`
is a slight over-estimate. That's deliberately conservative: scoring
penalises far targets a touch more than the truth, biasing selection
toward closer / safer captures.

`T_TOTAL` defaults to the Orbit Wars episode-step limit (500 per the
data/README spec). If a future game has a different limit, pass it
explicitly.
