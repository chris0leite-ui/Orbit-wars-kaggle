"""Value heads for v9 super-version lookahead rollouts.

A "value head" turns the terminal Snapshot of a K-step rollout into a
single scalar score. The lookahead chooser uses the score to rank
candidate actions. Today we use `delta_us_minus_them` (our minus
their total ships). For v9 we add `inflight_value` which extends the
K-step horizon by an extra 30 turns of static-substrate look-ahead
to credit in-flight fleets that will arrive AFTER the rollout
horizon.

Motivation: the receding-horizon pathology (documented in
`audit/2026-05-12-v4-planner-receding-horizon-pathology.md`).
At K=10 the rollout's leaf state may still have ships in flight
toward a planet they'll capture at eta=11–15. The naive ship-delta
head rates these ships as pure COST (ships not yet on a planet). A
candidate that does NOT launch them keeps them at home and scores
higher — even though the launching candidate would actually win
the capture. This biases lookahead toward "wait" / "don't fire".

`inflight_value` fixes this by building a `WorldModel` over the
terminal Snapshot and reading predicted ownership at terminal+30.
Fleets that arrive within that extended horizon and flip ownership
in our favour contribute their target's production × time-to-hold
to the score.

`composite_capture_value` (2026-05-14) extends this with two more
terms motivated by the PI observation that depth-2 search was biased
toward passive play and we were wasting ships:
- **Capture bonus:** for each of our in-flight fleets, predict whether
  it will land successfully and, if so, credit the captured planet's
  production × remaining episode steps. Directly rewards "go conquer
  the right planets."
- **Waste penalty:** subtract a fraction of ship counts for fleets
  that won't capture — either because they're targeting nothing
  (OOB / sun trajectory) or because they'll bounce off a stronger
  defender. Directly penalises "don't waste ships by sending too few
  or by not conquering."
