"""Intent + World + realize() — the substrate for the strategy/mechanism split.

A **strategy** emits `list[Intent]` ("attack planet T from source S with ~K
ships"). The **mechanism layer** (lib/mechanism.py) transforms that list
through a fixed pipeline (validate → arrival_size → lead_aim → comet_aim →
sun_avoid) before `realize()` emits env-format actions.

This separation lets every future strategy inherit the obvious-rule wins
(production-aware sizing, sun-avoidance, comet-path leading) uniformly,
and lets us run ablation tournaments where the same strategy plays with
different mechanism subsets to measure each mechanism's contribution.
