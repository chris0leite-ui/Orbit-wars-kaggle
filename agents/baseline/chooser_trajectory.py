"""Trajectory-first chooser — drop-in alternative to `chooser.choose`.

Replaces the K-step fast_sim rollout + composite-leaf-value approach
with deterministic trajectory analysis + single-tick combat prediction.

Pipeline per turn:
  1. Iterate proposer's prerank candidates in cheap-Δ order.
  2. For each candidate `(src, tgt, ships, angle, eta, wait_N)`:
     a. `predict_fleet_fate(src, tgt, angle, ships, world)` — drop
        on `sun` / `oob` / `timeout` / `planet` (path-blocked by a
        different planet) / `comet_collision` (predicted-hit comet).
     b. For surviving "target" outcomes that ARE comets, drop if the
        comet's remaining lifetime ≤ ETA (expires before arrival).
     c. `predict_garrison_at(tgt, eta, ledger[tgt.id] + [our arrival])`
        — single-tick combat result.
     d. Score:
          captured (was-enemy → now-us)  → production × time_remaining,
                                            capped at comet life.
          reinforced (already-ours)      → skip (no extra credit;
                                            threat reinforcement is
                                            handled at proposer.propose).
          bounced (still-not-us)         → -ships (waste penalty).
  3. Sort surviving by score desc; greedy non-dogpile dedup by
     (src_id, tgt_id); emit `wait_N==0` winners only (`wait_N>0`
     reserves src+tgt, emits nothing this turn).

No K-step rollout, no leaf value-function approximation, no fast_sim
state cloning. Cost is O(candidates × (trajectory_steps + eta + arrivals)).

PI critique 2026-05-17: "we should be thinking in fleet trajectories";
"sun-deaths should be 0% with proper trajectory analysis". See
`knowledge-base/concepts/trajectory-first-architecture.md`.
