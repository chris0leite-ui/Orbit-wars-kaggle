"""Leaf value function: F1 + F2 favor with PV-discounted production.

F1 = my_ships - opp_ships_agg          (in-flight + on-planet)
F2 = (my_prod - opp_prod_agg) * pv     (pv = pv_horizon discount)

PV-discount keeps F2 on a comparable scale to F1; without it the future-
production term over-weights captures by ~100x in late game and the
chooser stops valuing ship preservation. opp aggregation is max-of-opps
in 2P (unchanged from baseline) and weighted-sum-of-opps in 4P
(weakest opp 1.5x).

A2 (4P weakness exploitation) derives from
romantamrazov/orbit-star-wars-lb-max-1224 (peak LB μ=1224, +109 above
our v15 ceiling).

  - 4P: 1.5x bias on the WEAKEST opponent's contribution; other opps
    unweighted. Biases leaf valuation toward states that further
    weaken (or eliminate) them.
  - Elimination bonus: +55 when weakest's strength (ships + 15*prod)
    <= 110 AND my_strength >= 0.9 * weakest's (only fire when WE can
    finish — no elim-then-die bias). 4P only.

History — 2P bias was tested and rolled back: a uniform 1.25x
multiplier on the single opp regressed h2h vs v15 in 2P (25/64,
39.1%, Wlo=0.281, Whi=0.513 INCONCLUSIVE) because v15 is well-tuned
and biasing the chooser toward attacks degrades its calibration.
The "weakness exploitation" thesis is 4P-specific (per-weakest, not
uniform); the 2P path is unchanged from the original baseline.

Opt-in alternative head: `BASELINE_VALUE_HEAD=composite` switches the
chooser to `lib.value_heads.composite_capture_value` (waste +
capture-aware per-fleet credit). 2P-only — composite does not
distinguish opp identity in 4P. Default remains `favor` with A2.
