## Where we are

- **Comp:** Orbit Wars (slug `orbit-wars`). Deadline 2026-06-23 23:59 UTC →
  **45 days remaining**. Sponsor Google. $50k pool, 10×$5k prizes (1st–10th).
- **Submitted agent:** none. **Submission budget used today: 0/5.**
  **Total submissions: 0** (PI sign-off required before the first push).
- **Gap to top-5%:** unknown — leaderboard not yet read this session
  (next-session first-action #1). Initial μ₀=600 on the first submit;
  TrueSkill σ shrinks over the first ~24 h of ladder play.
- **Repo state:** seed imported from
  `chris0leite-ui/Kaggle-playground-may-2026 @ claude/orbit-war-setup-KbeKq:orbit-wars-seed/`,
  pushed to `origin/claude/orbit-wars-bootstrap-irewT`. Day-1 audit
  + scripts added. `data/` populated by `bootstrap.sh`.
- **Pre-baseline gate:** all artifacts present except `our_v0` (deferred
  to next session). PI sign-off pending.
- **Local environment:** Python 3.11, `kaggle 2.1.2`,
  `kaggle-environments 1.29.1`. Kaggle CLI auth requires
  `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN="$KAGGLE_KEY"` to be exported each shell — see friction.

## Today's progress

Load-bearing only; full detail in `audit/2026-05-09-day-1-data-inventory.md`.

1. **Comp-context TBDs filled** (rules + evaluation pages):
   team_size_limit=5, data_license=Apache-2.0, winner_license=CC-BY-4.0,
   external_data permitted (subject to Reasonableness), **NO ingress/egress
   during evaluation** (rules §2.12 — runtime models/data MUST be embedded
   in the submission). Prize structure clarified: 10 × $5k.
2. **Shipped baseline beats `random` 6/6** in 6 seeds, by elimination
   (n_steps 111–309). Calibration ceiling, not ladder strength.
3. **Self-play P0/P1 asymmetry — new finding (ISSUES.md A.6).**
   Baseline-vs-baseline: P1 wins 4/6, P0 wins 1/6, exact tie 1/6.
   All four 500-step games end with P1 ahead by 20–30% on ship count.
   Validation gate (Kaggle's self-vs-self pre-submit check) PASSES
   regardless — no crashes, all 6 reach `DONE`.
4. **Orbit-prediction math verified — A.1 done.**
   `scripts/orbit_prediction_check.py` proves the absolute formula
   `init_angle + ω·N` is **off by exactly one step's rotation**
   (~1.27 units on inner planets at orb_r≈31). Two correct alternatives:
   `ω·(N-1)` for the absolute case, or — preferred — relative projection
   from current obs by `ω·lead_turns`. Static planets confirmed
   non-drifting over 100 steps.
5. **Frictions logged** (`audit/friction.md`): KGAT_-token vs `kaggle.json`
   401, blinker pip conflict, seed-repo out-of-MCP-scope.

## Falsified-or-dead

- (none yet — no levers tried beyond the shipped baseline rollouts)

## Next-session first-action

Ranked. EV is qualitative on Day 1 (no calibration ladder yet); cost
is wallclock on local CPU.

1. **Read the live leaderboard** (cost: <1 min, EV: high).
   `kaggle competitions leaderboard orbit-wars -s` to learn the
   top-5%-μ threshold + the typical-bot-name landscape; record in
   `state/current.md` and update `comp-context.md::our_best_rank`
   (currently empty).
2. **B.1 heuristic v0 — overshoot variant** (cost: ~30 min coding +
   ~10 min self-play eval × M seeds, EV: medium-high). Send
   `garrison * 1.10 + 1` instead of `garrison + 1`; this absorbs
   one or two production ticks during fleet travel and prevents
   "captured then immediately recaptured" failure mode that the
   shipped baseline almost certainly exhibits. Check the winrate
   against the shipped baseline on D.1's panel; goal ≥55% to clear
   the validation-gate analogue (Rule 3 / G13). **Do NOT submit
   without PI sign-off.**
3. **D.1 local-tournament fixture** (cost: ~30 min, EV: high — every
   later experiment depends on it). Thin wrapper around
   `kaggle_environments.evaluate()` that returns a winrate matrix for
   `[random, baseline, our_vN] × M seeds`. Persist JSON output to
   `audit/`. Use 32 seeds for ±9pp 95% CI bootstrap to start; scale
   later per D.3.
4. **A.6 confirm/refute self-play asymmetry** (cost: ~10 min, EV:
   medium — could be load-bearing or could be variance with N=6).
   Patch the shipped baseline with random tie-breaks on equidistant
   targets (one-line change), re-run baseline-vs-baseline 32 seeds,
   measure P0 vs P1 winrate. If it equalises, asymmetry is the
   tie-break; if it doesn't, dig into turn-order semantics.
5. **(Defer)** RL training (B.4), reference-notebook pull (deferred
   per kickoff prompt; only on plateau), and any submission. The
   first submission should wait until step 2 produces a v0 that
   demonstrably beats the shipped baseline on the local panel.

## Pointers

- `audit/2026-05-09-day-1-data-inventory.md` — comp data + baseline
  probe + orbit-math verification.
- `audit/2026-05-09-day-1-rollouts.json` — raw rollout rewards/ship-counts.
- `scripts/run_day1_rollouts.py` — driver for the 6-seed × 2-pairing rollouts.
- `scripts/orbit_prediction_check.py` — absolute (off-by-one) and
  relative formula verification on seed 42.
- `data/README.md` — full game spec, comp-shipped (DO NOT modify).
- `comp-context.md` — settled facts, now with team_size, licences,
  ingress/egress policy, prize structure.
