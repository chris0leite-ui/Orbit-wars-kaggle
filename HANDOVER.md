## Read order (Rule 44 — mandatory)

1. **`state/MULTI_BRANCH.md`** — live Kaggle rolling pair, three-track
   registry (Analytical / Hybrid-Sim / Verify-first), closed tracks,
   push claim board.
2. **`state/TOOLS.md`** — A/B harnesses, single-game diagnostics,
   validation suite, consolidation-merge gate.
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** — rules 1-47 (rules 41-47 added 2026-05-20).
4. **This file** — session-start prompt below.
5. `audit/friction.md` if you're about to touch a fragile path.

## Where we are (2026-05-20 17:00 UTC)

- **Comp:** Orbit Wars. Deadline 2026-06-23 23:59 UTC. **34 days remain.**
- **Rolling-last-2 (Kaggle auto-keeps these two):**
  - 52857903 (μ 806.5) — analytical_wait_N_traj_plus_endgame_play (2026-05-20 16:12)
  - 52854094 (μ 829.1) — analytical (2026-05-20 13:59)
- **Team peak (EVICTED):** μ 1149.2 (sub 52744856, composite_a2_hybrid, 2026-05-17).
- **Floor lost in 24 h:** ~320 μ. The five-step eviction chain that
  caused this is documented in `state/MULTI_BRANCH.md` and is the
  origin of new Rule 42 (pre-submit cross-branch coordination gate).
- **Daily submission budget:** 5/day. 5/20 used: 2. 3 slots remain.
- **Floor-at-risk flag:** **TRUE** — rolling pair is 320 μ below team peak.

## What just landed (2026-05-20, this session)

This session was a **doc-only consolidation pass** across 8 active
branches. No code changed. New / edited docs:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `state/MULTI_BRANCH.md` | **NEW.** Single source of truth across branches. |
| `state/TOOLS.md` | **NEW.** Tools registry (A/B + diag + validation). |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Rules 41-47 appended. Pointers section adds MULTI_BRANCH + TOOLS. |
| `.claude/skills/kaggle-comp/SKILL.md` | Step 0 "load MULTI_BRANCH + TOOLS first" preamble. |
| `.claude/skills/kaggle-comp/day-loop.md` | Step 1 amendment for code-comp branch coordination. |
| `.claude/skills/kaggle-comp/improvements.md` | Rotated: 7 items promoted to rules; 2 superseded. |
| `.claude/skills/kaggle-comp/improvements-archive-2026-05-20.md` | **NEW.** Rotation archive. |
| `state/current.md` | Deprecated to pointer-only banner. |
| `state/mechanism-ledger.md` | Appended 2026-05-18 → 5-20 entries. |
| `HANDOVER.md` | Rewritten (this file). |

**Rules 41-47 summary (read CLAUDE.md for full text):**

- **41.** Confound-sweep before correlational conclusion (btjeK origin).
- **42.** Pre-submit cross-branch coordination gate (the ~320 μ loss origin).
- **43.** Multi-opponent panel mandatory pre-submit (supersedes `--vs-panel` pending item).
- **44.** State-of-truth read before subsystem edits (supersedes "read state docs" pending item).
- **45.** n ≥ 32 minimum for A/B lift claims.
- **46.** Bundle + parity smoke before any submission.
- **47.** Physics-primitive verification before agent design (PFhzM origin).

## Three parallel tracks — current state

| Track | Lead branch | Best result | Status | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A — Analytical chooser** | `strategy-framework-design-OyoYR-rebased` | μ 829.1 (sub 52854094) — both live pushes regressed | knowledge-base 5/20: "axis closed (10 slices, 0 lift)"; architectural bind: analytical needs multi-turn glue OR must replace rollout entirely | Decide: park, or pivot to analytical-leaf-inside-rollout |
| **B — Hybrid-sim production** | `audit-workflow-performance-btjeK` (production) + `analyze-game-strategy-EpMVP` (phases) | μ 1149.2 (EVICTED) | Live champion lineage. H44 finding 5/20: 65% fleet-destroyed-in-flight — new physics-driven mechanism candidate | (i) hold-feasibility solo validation (btjeK Phase B); (ii) H44 defensive mechanism design; (iii) EpMVP Phase 4/6 commissioning |
| **C — Verify-first + Goal-directed** | `ml-competition-strategy-PFhzM` (+ `precision-physics-engine-ymJkA` substrate) | Phase A Test 3 PASS; wrap-baseline 12/32 = 37.5% (only positive signal vs production) | greedy_expand (60 LOC) tied goal_planner (500 LOC); chooser axis confirmed neutral | Decide: is wrap-baseline-as-veto a viable design? Or is Track-C work substrate-only? |

## Next-session first actions (ranked by EV / cost)

### Priority 1 — code consolidation pass (start small, parity-tested)

Following the 6-step consolidation-merge gate in `state/TOOLS.md`:

1. **Substrate primitives** (no chooser changes piggy-backed):
   - Merge `lib/trajectory_layer.py` + `tests/test_trajectory_layer_positions.py` from PFhzM.
   - Merge `agents/precision/sim.py` + `agents/precision/intercept.py` + `agents/precision/tests/` from precision-physics branch.
   - Run consolidation gate; expected: GREEN.
2. **Bundler upgrade** from EpMVP — "inline agent submodules + explicit-name imports."
3. **Diagnostic scripts** (zero-risk leaf merges):
   - `scripts/h44_landing_capture_diagnostic.py` (btjeK)
   - `scripts/probe_emits_via_fate.py` (PFhzM)
   - `scripts/inspect_goal_planner_game.py` (PFhzM)
4. **Oracle tests** (test-only, zero-risk):
   - `tests/test_baseline_replay_regression.py` (EpMVP)
   - `tests/test_migration_solver.py` (EpMVP)

### Priority 2 — recovery submission planning

The rolling-last-2 is 320 μ below team peak. Three sub-IDs have evidence
of being strong:

- **52744856** (μ 1149.2, composite_a2_hybrid 2P + A2 4P)
- **52754310** (μ 1143.7, trajectory v4 + wait_N + wallclock)
- **52811320** (μ 1135.1, hold-feasibility solo)

**Open PI question:** which lineage to rebundle and push? The push will
itself need to clear Rule 42 (claim board) and Rule 43 (panel + h2h)
before submit. Do NOT push without explicit PI sign-off.

### Priority 3 — Track-B physics mechanism design

H44 finding: 65% of landing-capture failures are fleet-destroyed-in-flight.
This is a substrate-level signal that the trajectory chooser's
fleet-safety filter is not catching. Design a defensive mechanism
(NOT a restriction-tuning constant bump — Rule 40) that emerges from
the underlying physics.

- `audit/2026-05-19-postmortem-PFhzM-physics-gate-and-mvp-confirmation.md` — Track-C verdict.

## Rule reminders (most relevant this session)

- **Rule 1:** submissions PI-approved, single-shot, no retry loops.
- **Rule 12:** rolling-last-2; weak late submits unrecoverable for ~24h.
- **Rule 32:** session-start git fetch; verify rolling pair via Kaggle CLI.
- **Rule 35-36:** PI thoughts append-only; session-end second-brain update.
- **Rule 37:** 3-variant axis cap. v9-v15 chooser hit it; chain-bonus hit it; analytical-slice hit it (10/3+).
- **Rule 40:** prefer modeling-correctness over restriction-tuning.
- **Rules 41-47 (new today):** see CLAUDE.md.

## Open questions for PI

1. Track A (analytical) — park or pivot to analytical-leaf-inside-rollout?
2. Track C — wrap-baseline-as-veto, or substrate-only contribution?
3. Recovery submission — which lineage to rebundle for the next push?
4. Should the SessionStart hook implementation (improvements.md TOP
   PRIORITY) get priority over the code consolidation pass?
